# practice


practiced various topics to master them

1. array.forEach() - executes a callback function for each array

2. array.map() - executes a callback function for each array and creates a new array

3. array.filter() - creates a new array that passes the given test

4. array.reduce() - reduces array to a single value

5. Array sorting - using .sort() method

6. Map - object that holds key-value pairs of any datatype

7. Objects - group of properties and methods, created various objects and referenced them using .this keyword

8. Classes - blueprint for creating objects, using constructor for unique properties

9. static keyword - that belongs to class and not objects

10. inheritance - child class inheriting methods and properties from the parent class

11. super keyword - used to tie and use constructors of parent class from child class

12. get - binds an object property to a function when accessed

13. set - binds an object property to a function when assigned a value

14. anonymous objects - objects without a name that are not directly referenced

15. Error handling - using try and catch methods, throw keyword - executes a user-defined error

16. setTimeout() - invokes a function after a number of milliseconds

17. setInterval() - invokes a func repeatedly after a no. of milliseconds

18. Date objects -  used to work with date and time 

19. synchronous function - in an ordered sequence, with step by step instructions

20. asynchronous function - out of sequence, tasks that take time

21. console.time() - starts a timer you can use to track how long an operation takes
    give each timer a unique number
    
22. promises - objects that encapsulates the result of an asynchronous operation
    lets async methods return values like sync methods
    "promising to return something in the future"
 
23. async keyword makes a function return a promise
    await - makes an async function wait for a promise
